# patchless-nnUnet

Code repository for patchless version of the nnUnet.

(Inspired by https://github.com/creatis-myriad/ASCENT/)

## Description

This code base allows you to train a 3D Unet for a multi-classs segmentation task with images stored in nifti format.

## Install

1. Download the repository:
   ```bash
   # clone project
   git clone https://github.com/arnaudjudge/patchless-nnUnet
   cd patchless-nnUnet
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment (Conda is strongly recommended):
   ```bash
   # create conda environment
   conda create -n patchless python=3.10
   conda activate patchless
   ```
3. Install [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) according to instructions. Grab the one with GPU for faster training:
   ```bash
   # example for linux or Windows
   conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=11.8 -c pytorch -c nvidia
   ```
4. Install the project in editable mode and its dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

## Data

The images used with this project are 3d (H x W x timestep) and are saved in the nifti format.
The dataloader assumes a file hierarchy format associated with a csv dataframe.
Each image is saved in a folder associated with it's study id, and view.
The filename corresponds to the dicom uuid of the image.
Images and their respective ground truth labels are stored in separate, by identically formatted folders ('img' and 'segmentation') residing one next to another.
Images and their segmentation map that are to be used in the training must be identified with the 'valid_segmentation' column in the dataframe.
* Currently, images are required to have the _0000 suffix.
### Example:

dataframe.csv:

| index | dicom_uuid        | ... | study  | view | valid_segmentation |
|-------|-------------------|-----|--------|------|--------------------|
| 0     | di-1234-ABCD-5678 | ... | study1 | a2c  | True               |
| 1     | di-5678-EFGH-1234 | ... | study2 | a4c  | True               |
| ...   | ...               | ... | ...    | ...  | ...                |
| 500   | di-WXYZ-6789-ABCD | ... | study3 | a4c  | True               |

The associated files would be:

```
## Training

To train the network, use the following command:
```bash
patchless_train experiment=patchless
```
Many options are available through hydra CLI override syntax or through modification/addition of config files.

For example:
```bash
patchless_train experiment=patchless trainer.max_epochs=20 model.save_predictions=True
```

## Evaluation

To run evaluation of a model, use the following command. Make sure to specify input and output folder as well as model checkpoint to use.
```bash
patchless_eval experiment=patchless ckpt_path=<CKPT_PATH>
```


## Inference

To run inference on a set of new images, use the following command. Make sure to specify input and output folder as well as model checkpoint to use.
```bash
patchless_predict model=patchless_nnunet input_folder=<INPUT_PATH> output_folder=<OUTPUT_PATH> ckpt_path=<CKPT_PATH>
```


## Define custom data and logs path

In some cases, you may want to specify your own data and logs paths instead of using the default `data/` and `logs/`. You can do this by setting them in environments variables after renaming the [.env.example](.env.example) file to `.env`. In the `.env`, simply override:

```bash
# custom data path
PNNU_DATA_PATH="path/to/data"

# custom logs path
PNNU_LOGS_PATH="paths/to/logs"
```

After that, you must override `paths=custom` in all your commands, e.g.:

```bash
# to use custom data and logs paths
python runner.py experiment=patchless paths=custom
```
